45.You should use a **Validation rule** if:

A. You want to improve user efficiency by limiting the number of available options in a lookup search dialog.

**B. You're close to the maximum number of lookup filters allowed.**

C. You want to improve user efficiency by automating filters on lookup search dialogs that your users manually set.
